   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. What is this?

   These are wrappers for malloc-related functions.  They always check if
   corespondent function did not return NULL in which case they just finish
   program with error message.  They can also find memory leaks in your
   program.


   2. How can I find my memory leaks?

   It is very simple.  Compile this module with -DXMALLOC_DEBUG option, then
   define environment variable XMALLOC_TRACE, so that it is a valid name of
   file which can be overwritten.  Run your program, and after it finishes
   use mtrace script (which is part of GNU libc).

        $ export XMALLOC_TRACE=xmalloc.log
        $ ./my_prog
        $ mtrace my_prog xmalloc.log
        No memory leaks.


   3. Deeper tracing.

   The mtrace script has one disadvantage, that is not disabled with
   xmalloc wrappers.  If you have many objects used in many different
   places in your program you will get confused very fast with messages
   that you get from mtrace.  This is because mtrace can only show you
   one stack frame.  I worked this around by writing ntrace utility.

   You need to compile your program with -DXMALLOC_DEPTH=4 (or even more
   if you wish).  Now:

        $ export XMALLOC_TRACE=xmalloc.log
        $ ./my_prog
        $ ntrace.exe my_prog xmalloc.log

        Memory not freed:
        -----------------
          Address       Size    Caller
        0x810a830       65      /home/rzyj/projekty/elmo/src/str.c:76
                                /home/rzyj/projekty/elmo/src/str.c:86
                                /home/rzyj/projekty/elmo/src/debug.c:266
                                /home/rzyj/projekty/elmo/src/debug.c:345
        Total memory not freed: 65

   Ntrace is also much faster than mtrace.
