    <h1>Translating Whole Files</h1>
    <p>
      You can submit a .po file for translation to the server (the
      service is based on the 
      <a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net">translate toolkit</a>
      and understands many other formats supported by this library).
    </p>
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="suggest" method="post">
      File: <input type="file" name="file"/><br/>
      <input type="submit" value="Translate"/>
    </form>
-->
    <h1>Translating Single Phrases</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You can add a search engine (<a href="/suggest/search engine">check out
        suggested translations</a>) to any modern web browser.
	<br/>
	<img src="/images/open-search.png" alt="Open Search"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        It's not a secret that the search form enters a URL of the
	following format:
	<a href="/suggest/search engine">http://xx.open-tran.eu/suggest/search engine</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Firefox users may add a bookmark with a keyword.  In order to
	do this one needs to open the "Organize Bookmarks" window from
        the "Bookmarks" menu and add a new one as follows:<br/><br/>
        <img src="images/addbookmark-en.png" alt="screenshot"/><br/><br/>
        Now, entering a URL of the form <code>tran phrase</code> will
	automatically submit a search query.
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h1>XML RPC</h1>
    <p>
      You can use this service with any program that is capable of
      calling a remote procedure via the
      <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">XML RPC</a> protocol.  You
      should use the method <code>suggest</code>, which takes two
      arguments: a phrase to be translated and a destination language
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python, you can use it in the following way:
    </p>
    <pre>
      from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy

      lang = "pt_BR" # replace with your language code
      server = ServerProxy("<a href="http://open-tran.eu/RPC2">http://open-tran.eu/RPC2</a>")
      for sugg in server.suggest("save as", lang):
          print sugg
    </pre>
    <p>
      I will try to upload a simple .po editor soon that will be able
      to fetch suggestions from the server using this mechanism.
    </p>
